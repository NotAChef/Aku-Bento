## Disclaimer  
Even if it is more of a fun party trick than something that could actually do any harm, please use it respectfully! Some people might interpret this as a "Jammer" and those are illegal. But this project is just sending a bunch of WiFi packets through the air and works within the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard.
